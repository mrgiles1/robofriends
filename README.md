This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Robofriends
A project that uses react to build a single page application. In this project I learned:

### Functional vs Class Components
A class component is usually considered a 'smart' component because it requires a state,
whereas a functional component (aka a pure function) does not.

### Props vs State vs Children
Props derive from a parent state and are immutable. State describes the application and can be updated by the component itself.
Function LifeCycle Methods

### Mounting / Updating / UnMounting

### Pure Functions
A pure function is deterministic and has no side-effects (changes observable by the outside world)
